What I Learned
This project helped me reinforce my understanding of CSS flexbox and custom properties. I also improved my skills in creating responsive designs using a mobile-first approach.

Here are some code snippets I'm proud of:

html
Copy code

<div id="name">Jessica Randall</div>
<div id="location">London, United Kingdom</div>
<p id="description">"Front-end developer and avid reader."</p>
css
Copy code
body {
  background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 8%);
  height: 100vh;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
Continued Development
In future projects, I want to focus on:

Enhancing accessibility features.
Improving animation and transition effects.
Exploring more advanced CSS techniques such as CSS Grid.
Useful Resources
